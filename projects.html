          <h2>Resolving Network Congestion in Industrial DCS Systems</h2>

          <h3>Role: Lead Network Developer</h3>

           <p>
            In the industrial Distributed Control System (DCS) environments, we faced 
            a persistent <strong>network congestion issue</strong>. The congestion was caused by 
            <strong>improperly configured switches</strong>, which led to significant packet loss 
            in Foundation Fieldbus network. The source of the problem was 
            unclear at first, and it threatened the stability of critical industrial operations.
          </p>

           <h3>Investigation & R&amp;D</h3>
            <p>
              I conducted intensive research and experimentation across multiple industrial sites. 
              Through detailed analysis and trial, I identified that the issue stemmed from 
              <strong>improper IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) handling</strong> in the network.
            </p>

              <h3>Achievements</h3>
            <p>
              The result was a <strong>stable and reliable industrial network</strong>. Packet loss 
              was completely eliminated, and the system returned to normal operation. 
              This improvement significantly increased the <strong>resilience and availability</strong> 
              of critical DCS communications.

        <h2>Migrating DCS to Modern Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)</h2>

          <p>
            Over the course of two years, I led a project to modernize a legacy Distributed Control System (DCS) 
            by migrating from traditional infrastructure to a <strong>Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)</strong>. 
            This transformation significantly enhanced flexibility, 
            resilience, and efficiency in managing industrial operations.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            <li>Served as <strong>Team Lead</strong>, overseeing planning, execution, and validation of the migration project.</li>
            <li>Guided cross-functional teams through the transition from traditional physical hardware to modern virtualized infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Ensured alignment with industry best practices for <strong>virtualization, storage, and system availability</strong>.</li>
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            <li>Implemented the latest <strong>VMware-based virtualized servers</strong> to host core DCS functions.</li>
            <li>Deployed <strong>Software-Defined Storage (SDS)</strong> for flexible, scalable, and resilient data management.</li>
            <li>Integrated a <strong>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)</strong> to provide secure access for engineering and monitoring stations.</li>
            <li>Leveraged advanced VMware features such as <strong>High Availability (HA)</strong> and <strong>Fault Tolerance (FT)</strong> to maximize uptime.</li>
          </p>

          <h3>Achievements</h3>
          <p>
            The migration delivered a <strong>future-ready DCS infrastructure</strong> with improved reliability, 
            lower operational costs, and stronger business continuity. By adopting hyper-converged infrastructure, 
            the system gained the agility to scale while ensuring the <strong>highest levels of availability 
            and security</strong> for critical industrial processes.
